# Reinforcement Learning

Hello! Welcome to the github repo for the Summer of Science: Reinforcement Learning :)

All the material that will be covered in the project will be outlined here. You can treat this like a map to the project.

The most important book that you will be needing for reinforcement learning will be [Sutton and Barto](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf).

The part-wise content is in the respective folders.
